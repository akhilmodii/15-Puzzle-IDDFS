15-Puzzle game developed in Python 3.0. It can find the solution to any given condition in the game. Developed using BFS Algorithm.
I used PyCharm IDE for developing the game which is using Python 3.6.
I also ran the code on Windows Terminal where I had installed Python version 3.8.5 and it was working fine. You can run the file by using the py filename.py	In this case - python amodi20_bfs.py
